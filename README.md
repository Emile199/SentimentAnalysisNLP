# SentimentAnalysisNLP

The project is a sentiment analyzer that clasifies tweets as positive or negative, it also shows a live graph of the analysis of sentiment from a series of tweets.<br />

This project can help you to get acquainted with the NLTK and scikit-learn libraries<br />

For this project we followed the Sentdex tutorial to make a sentiment analyzer from Twitter. You can find the tutorial in the following link:<br />

To get started with the project you must have in the same directory the following documents in order to run the code correctly: positive.txt, negative.txt, twitter-out.txt, naivebayes.pickle and the code file, in this case it is called SentimentAnalysis. <br />

You also need to take into account the requirements.txt file, which helps us to replicate the environment that was used to run the code. <br />
